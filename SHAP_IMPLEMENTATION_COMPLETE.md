## üéØ How SHAP Works

### What is SHAP?
**SHAP** (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is a game-theoretic approach to explain model predictions.

### Key Concepts:

#### 1. SHAP Values
- Shows **contribution** of each feature to the prediction
- Positive value = pushes prediction towards fraud
- Negative value = pushes prediction towards legitimate
- Sum of SHAP values = prediction - base value

#### 2. Base Value
- Expected model output (average prediction)
- Starting point before considering features

#### 3. Feature Contributions
- How much each feature changed the prediction
- Ranked by absolute importance

## üìä What You Get

### For Single Instance Explanation:

```json
{
  "prediction": {
    "class": 1,
    "probability": 0.87,
    "label": "Fraud"
  },
  "base_value": 0.076,

    {
      "feature": "TransactionAmt",
      "value": 1500.0,
      "shap_value": 0.45,
      "abs_shap_value": 0.45
    },
    {
      "feature": "card1",
      "value": 12345,
      "shap_value": 0.23,
      "abs_shap_value": 0.23
    },
    ...
  ],
  "top_features": [...],  // Top 10 most important
}
```

### For Global Feature Importance:

```json
{
  "feature_importance": [
    {
      "feature": "TransactionAmt",
      "importance": 0.234,
      "rank": 1
    },
    {
      "feature": "card1",
      "importance": 0.187,
      "rank": 2
    },
    ...
  ],
  "top_features": [...],  // Top 20
  "num_samples": 1000,
  "num_features": 452
}
```

## üöÄ How to Use

### 1. Generate Global Feature Importance

```bash
# Get token
TOKEN=$(curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"researcher@xai.com","password":"research123"}' | \
  python3 -c "import sys, json; print(json.load(sys.stdin)['access_token'])")

# Generate explanation for XGBoost model
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/explanations/generate \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model_id": "d941370a-b058-4bcc-8b72-3dcac17d1af4",
    "method": "shap",
    "config": {}
  }'
```

### 2. Check Explanation Status

```bash
# Get explanation by ID
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/explanations/{explanation_id} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

### 3. View Results

The explanation will include:
- Feature importance rankings
- SHAP values for each feature
- Top contributing features
- Prediction details

## üí° Example Use Cases

### 1. Why was this transaction flagged as fraud?
**Answer:** SHAP shows:
- Transaction amount was unusually high (+0.45)
- Card was used in suspicious location (+0.23)
- Time of day was unusual (+0.18)
- **Total contribution:** 0.86 (high fraud probability)

### 2. What features are most important for fraud detection?
**Answer:** SHAP global importance shows:
1. TransactionAmt (23.4% importance)
2. card1 (18.7% importance)
3. addr1 (12.3% importance)
4. dist1 (9.8% importance)
5. C1 (8.2% importance)

### 3. How do different models use features?
**Answer:** Compare SHAP values across models:
- XGBoost relies heavily on TransactionAmt
- Random Forest uses more diverse features
- CatBoost balances multiple factors
