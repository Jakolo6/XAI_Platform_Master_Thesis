# ⚠️ Kaggle API Authentication Issue

## Current Status

✅ **Kaggle credentials are configured correctly:**
- Username: `jaakoob6`
- API Key: `20564917d23bed39607e4e27250fb5bb`
- File location: `~/.kaggle/kaggle.json` ✅
- Docker container can read the file ✅

❌ **But Kaggle API returns 401 Unauthorized**

## What This Means

The Kaggle API is rejecting your credentials with:
```
HTTP 401 - Unauthorized
{"code":401,"message":"Unauthenticated"}
```

## Possible Causes

1. **API Key Expired** - Kaggle API keys can expire
2. **API Key Not Activated** - New keys need to be activated
3. **Wrong API Key** - The key might be from a different account
4. **Account Issue** - Your Kaggle account might have restrictions

## How to Fix

### Option 1: Generate a New API Key

1. Go to: https://www.kaggle.com/settings
2. Scroll to "API" section
3. Click "**Expire API Token**" (if one exists)
4. Click "**Create New API Token**"
5. Download the new `kaggle.json` file
6. Copy it to `~/.kaggle/kaggle.json`:
   ```bash
   cp ~/Downloads/kaggle.json ~/.kaggle/kaggle.json
   ```
7. Restart worker:
   ```bash
   docker-compose restart celery_worker
   ```

### Option 2: Verify Your Current Key

1. Test the key manually:
   ```bash
   curl -u jaakoob6:20564917d23bed39607e4e27250fb5bb \
     https://www.kaggle.com/api/v1/competitions/list
   ```

2. If this returns 401, the key is definitely invalid

### Option 3: Check Kaggle Account

1. Make sure you're logged into Kaggle
2. Verify your account is in good standing
3. Check if you've accepted Kaggle's terms of service

## Alternative: Use Pre-Downloaded Dataset

If Kaggle authentication continues to fail, you can:

1. **Download dataset manually:**
   - Go to: https://www.kaggle.com/c/ieee-fraud-detection/data
   - Download `train_transaction.csv` and `train_identity.csv`
   - Place them in: `data/raw/`

2. **Create dataset entry manually:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/datasets/ \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "name": "IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection (Manual)",
       "description": "Manually downloaded dataset",
       "source": "manual"
     }'
   ```

3. **Trigger preprocessing:**
   ```bash
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/datasets/DATASET_ID/preprocess \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
   ```

## Next Steps

**Please try generating a fresh API key from Kaggle:**
1. Visit https://www.kaggle.com/settings
2. Expire old token
3. Create new token
4. Download kaggle.json
5. Replace `~/.kaggle/kaggle.json`
6. Restart celery worker

Then we can continue with model training!
