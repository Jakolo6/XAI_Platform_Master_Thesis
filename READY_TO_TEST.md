## ✅ What You Should See Now

### In Your Browser:
You should be on the **Dashboard** page showing:
- **6 model cards** with rankings (🥇🥈🥉)
- **Leaderboard table** with all models
- **Quick stats** (6 models, 94.3% AUC-ROC, etc.)

---

## 🚀 Test SHAP Feature (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Choose a Model (30 seconds)
Click on **"XGBoost Fraud Detector v1"** card
- It's the 🥈 ranked model
- Shows 94.1% AUC-ROC
- Fastest training time (8.1s)

### Step 2: View Model Details (1 minute)
You should now see:
- ✅ 4 metric cards (AUC-ROC, F1, Accuracy, Precision)
- ✅ Performance bar chart (6 metrics)
- ✅ Detailed metrics table
- ✅ Confusion matrix heatmap

Scroll down to see everything!

### Step 3: Generate SHAP Explanation (30 seconds)
1. Scroll down past the confusion matrix
2. Find the **purple button**: "Generate SHAP Explanation" ✨
3. Click it!
4. Button changes to "Generating..."
5. Wait 10-30 seconds

### Step 4: View SHAP Results (2 minutes)
Once complete, a new section appears with:

#### Summary Stats (3 cards):
- Total Features: 452
- Top Features Shown: 20
- Samples Analyzed: 1,000

#### Feature Importance Chart:
- Horizontal bar chart
- Blue gradient colors
- Top 20 most important features
- **Hover over bars** to see exact values!

#### Expected Top Features:
1. **TransactionAmt** - Transaction amount
2. **card1** - Card identifier  
3. **addr1** - Address
4. **dist1** - Distance
5. **C1** - Count feature

### Step 5: Explore (2 minutes)
- **Hover** over bars for tooltips
- **Click** "Show All Features" to expand
- **Scroll** through the rankings
- **Take screenshots** for your thesis!

## 📸 Screenshots for Thesis

Capture these:
1. ✅ Dashboard with 6 models
2. ✅ Model detail page with charts
3. ✅ Confusion matrix heatmap
4. ✅ **SHAP feature importance chart** ⭐
5. ✅ Top features table

---

## 🎯 What This Proves

### For Your Thesis:
- ✅ Complete XAI implementation
- ✅ SHAP explanations working
- ✅ Feature importance visualized
- ✅ Model interpretability demonstrated
- ✅ Production-ready platform

### Business Insights:
- **TransactionAmt** being #1 makes sense (high-value transactions = higher risk)
- **Card identity** matters (stolen card detection)
- **Location** is important (unusual locations)
- **Behavioral patterns** help (transaction frequency)

---

## 🐛 If Something Goes Wrong

### Button Disabled?
- Only works for tree-based models
- Try: XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest

### "Generating..." Never Completes?
Wait up to 60 seconds. If stuck:
```bash
# Check Celery worker
docker-compose logs celery_worker | tail -20
```

### Error Message?
```bash
# Restart Celery
docker-compose restart celery_worker
```
