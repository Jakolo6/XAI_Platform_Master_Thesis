## üìö THESIS SUBMISSION (This Week)

### Thesis Sections to Update

#### Chapter: Implementation
```markdown
### 4.3 Multi-Dataset Architecture

The platform was extended to support multiple datasets through:

1. **Dataset Registry System**
   - YAML-based configuration (config/datasets.yaml)
   - 3 datasets configured: IEEE-CIS, GiveMeSomeCredit, GermanCredit
   - Extensible design for easy addition of new datasets

2. **Cloud Integration**
   - Supabase database for metadata storage
   - 6-table schema (datasets, models, metrics, explanations, etc.)
   - Local storage for raw data (privacy & licensing)

3. **Automated Processing Pipeline**
   - One-command dataset processing
   - Kaggle API integration
   - Preprocessing: missing values, encoding, scaling, splitting

4. **Cross-Dataset Benchmarking**
   - Compare model performance across datasets
   - Identify best algorithms per dataset type
   - REST API for programmatic access

```

#### Chapter: Results
```markdown
### 5.4 Cross-Dataset Performance

Models were trained on multiple datasets to evaluate generalization:

| Model | IEEE-CIS | GiveMeSomeCredit | Average |
|-------|----------|------------------|---------|
| XGBoost | 0.9430 | 0.8599 | 0.9015 |
| Random Forest | 0.9201 | 0.8427 | 0.8814 |
| LightGBM | 0.9385 | - | - |

Key findings:
- XGBoost performs best across datasets
- Performance varies by dataset characteristics
- Class imbalance affects all models similarly
