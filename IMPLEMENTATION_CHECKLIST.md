## 📝 Notes & Decisions

### October 9, 2025
- ✅ Phase 1 complete - SHAP working perfectly
- ✅ Redis caching implemented for persistence
- ✅ Frontend auto-displays results without refresh
- 🎯 Next: Start LIME integration tomorrow

### Key Decisions Made:
- Using Redis for explanation caching (solved persistence issue)
- Focusing on LIME + SHAP first, DiCE optional
- Human study target: 20-30 participants
- Timeline: 8 weeks to completion

---

## 🚨 Blockers & Issues

### Current:
- None

### Resolved:
- ✅ Redis cache persistence (Oct 9)
- ✅ Frontend polling timeout (Oct 9)
- ✅ Auth persistence on refresh (Oct 9)
