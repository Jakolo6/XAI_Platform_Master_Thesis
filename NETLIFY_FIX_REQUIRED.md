# üö® NETLIFY DEPLOYMENT FIX - ACTION REQUIRED

## **Problem Identified:**

Your Netlify deployment is failing because **Supabase environment variables are missing**.

The build error shows:
```
Error: @supabase/ssr: Your project's URL and API key are required to create a Supabase client!
```

---

## **‚úÖ SOLUTION: Add Environment Variables to Netlify**

### **STEP 1: Get Your Supabase Credentials**

1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to **Settings** ‚Üí **API**
4. Copy these values:
   - **Project URL** (e.g., `https://xxxxx.supabase.co`)
   - **anon public** key (long string starting with `eyJ...`)

---

### **STEP 2: Add to Netlify**

1. Go to: https://app.netlify.com
2. Select your site
3. Go to **Site settings** ‚Üí **Environment variables**
4. Click **"Add a variable"** and add these:

#### **Variable 1:**
- **Key:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
- **Value:** `https://your-project.supabase.co` (your actual URL)
- **Scopes:** All scopes

#### **Variable 2:**
- **Key:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
- **Value:** `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...` (your actual key)
- **Scopes:** All scopes

#### **Variable 3 (Optional but recommended):**
- **Key:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`
- **Value:** `https://your-backend-url.com/api/v1`
- **Scopes:** All scopes

---

### **STEP 3: Trigger Rebuild**

After adding environment variables:

1. Go to **Deploys** tab
2. Click **"Trigger deploy"** ‚Üí **"Clear cache and deploy site"**
3. Wait 3-5 minutes for build to complete
4. Check deploy log for success ‚úÖ

---

## **üéØ Expected Result:**

After successful deploy, you should see:
- ‚úÖ Build completes without errors
- ‚úÖ New navigation with 7 items (Dashboard, Datasets, Train Model, Research, Human Study, Reports, Benchmarks)
- ‚úÖ Dashboard shows real model counts
- ‚úÖ All new pages accessible

---

## **üîç How to Verify:**

1. **Check Deploy Log:**
   - Should show: `‚úì Compiled successfully`
   - Should show: `‚úì Generating static pages`
   - Should NOT show: `Error: @supabase/ssr`

2. **Test Your Site:**
   ```
   https://your-site.netlify.app/dashboard
   https://your-site.netlify.app/research
   https://your-site.netlify.app/study
   https://your-site.netlify.app/reports
   ```

3. **Hard Refresh Browser:**
   - Mac: `Cmd + Shift + R`
   - Windows: `Ctrl + Shift + R`

---

## **üìã Quick Checklist:**

- [ ] Get Supabase URL from dashboard
- [ ] Get Supabase anon key from dashboard
- [ ] Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` to Netlify
- [ ] Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` to Netlify
- [ ] Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` to Netlify (optional)
- [ ] Trigger "Clear cache and deploy site"
- [ ] Wait for build to complete
- [ ] Hard refresh browser
- [ ] Test new pages

---

## **üö® If Still Failing:**

Check the deploy log for specific errors:
1. Go to **Deploys** tab
2. Click on the latest deploy
3. Scroll to **"Deploy log"**
4. Look for red error messages
5. Share the error message if you need help

---

## **üí° Why This Happened:**

- Your local `.env.local` file has these variables
- But Netlify doesn't have access to your local files
- Netlify needs environment variables configured in its dashboard
- This is a security feature - env vars are never committed to Git

---

## **‚úÖ After Fix:**

Once environment variables are added and the build succeeds:
- All your latest changes will be live
- Navigation will show all 7 pages
- Dashboard will show real data
- Human Study will work
- Reports page will work

**The code is ready - it just needs the environment variables!**
