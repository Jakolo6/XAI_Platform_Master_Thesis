- Uploads to R2
- Stores metadata in Supabase
- **NO CELERY NEEDED!**
- File: `backend/app/services/dataset_service.py`

### **4. Created Model Training Service** ✅
- Downloads processed data from R2
- Trains XGBoost/Random Forest
- Uploads model to R2
- Stores metrics in Supabase
- **NO CELERY NEEDED!**
- File: `backend/app/services/model_service.py`

### **5. Created New API Endpoints** ✅
- Simplified datasets endpoint
- Simplified models endpoint
- Uses BackgroundTasks instead of Celery
- Files: `datasets_new.py`, `models_new.py`

### **6. Updated API Router** ✅
- Now uses new endpoints
- File: `backend/app/api/v1/api.py`

## 🔧 WHAT YOU NEED TO DO (10 MINUTES)

### **Step 1: Create Supabase Tables (5 minutes)**

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard:**
   - Visit: https://supabase.com/dashboard
   - Select your project

2. **Open SQL Editor:**
   - Click "SQL Editor" in left sidebar
   - Click "New query"

3. **Run the SQL:**
   - Open file: `supabase_tables.sql`
   - Copy ALL the SQL
   - Paste into Supabase SQL Editor
   - Click "Run" or press Cmd/Ctrl + Enter

4. **Verify Tables Created:**
   - Click "Table Editor" in left sidebar
   - You should see: `datasets`, `models`, `explanations`, `benchmarks`

---

### **Step 2: Add Kaggle Credentials to Railway (2 minutes)**

1. **Get Kaggle API Credentials:**
   - Go to: https://www.kaggle.com/settings/account
   - Scroll to "API" section
   - Click "Create New Token"
   - Downloads `kaggle.json`

2. **Open kaggle.json:**
   ```json
   {
     "username": "your-username",
     "key": "your-api-key"
   }
   ```

3. **Add to Railway:**
   - Go to Railway dashboard
   - Click your backend service
   - Go to "Variables" tab
   - Add these TWO variables:
   
   ```
   KAGGLE_USERNAME=your-username-from-json
   KAGGLE_KEY=your-api-key-from-json
   ```

4. **Railway will auto-redeploy** (2-3 minutes)

## 🧪 HOW TO TEST

### **Test 1: Process a Dataset**

1. **Go to your frontend:**
   ```
   https://xai-working-project.netlify.app/datasets
   ```

2. **Click "Process Dataset" on any dataset**
   - Should show "Processing started" message
   - Processing takes 2-5 minutes

3. **Check status:**
   - Refresh the page after 2-3 minutes
   - Dataset should show as "completed"
   - Should show sample counts

### **Test 2: Train a Model**

1. **After dataset is processed:**
   ```
   https://xai-working-project.netlify.app/models
   ```

2. **Select processed dataset**
3. **Choose model type** (XGBoost or Random Forest)
4. **Click "Train Model"**
   - Should show "Training started" message
   - Training takes 5-10 minutes

5. **Check results:**
   - Go to Models page
   - Should see trained model with metrics

## 📊 WHAT WILL WORK

### **Dataset Processing:**
```
✅ Downloads from Kaggle
✅ Processes data (clean, split, engineer features)
✅ Uploads to R2 (persistent storage)
✅ Stores metadata in Supabase
✅ Shows real sample counts
✅ Shows processing time
```

### **Model Training:**
```
✅ Downloads processed data from R2
✅ Trains XGBoost or Random Forest
✅ Evaluates on test set
✅ Uploads model to R2
✅ Stores metrics in Supabase
✅ Shows accuracy, precision, recall, F1, AUC-ROC
✅ Shows feature importance
```

### **Benchmarks:**
```
✅ Lists all trained models
✅ Shows comparison metrics
✅ Real data, no mocks!
```

## ⏱️ EXPECTED TIMINGS

| Task | Time | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| **Dataset Download** | 30-60s | From Kaggle |
| **Dataset Processing** | 1-3 min | Depends on size |
| **Upload to R2** | 10-30s | Depends on size |
| **Total Processing** | 2-5 min | Per dataset |
| | | |
| **Model Training** | 3-8 min | Depends on model |
| **Model Upload** | 5-10s | Small file |

## 🎯 ARCHITECTURE

### **Data Flow:**

```
1. DATASET PROCESSING:
   User clicks "Process" 
   → Backend downloads from Kaggle to /tmp
   → Backend processes (clean, split, features)
   → Backend uploads to R2
   → Backend stores metadata in Supabase
   → User sees "Completed"

2. MODEL TRAINING:
   User clicks "Train"
   → Backend downloads processed data from R2 to /tmp
   → Backend trains model (XGBoost/RF)
   → Backend evaluates on test set
   → Backend uploads model to R2
   → Backend stores metrics in Supabase
   → User sees results
```

### **Storage:**
```
R2 (Cloudflare):
  - Raw datasets
  - Processed datasets (train/val/test)
  - Trained models
  - Explanation files

Supabase:
  - Dataset metadata
  - Model metrics
  - Explanation metadata
  - Benchmark results
```

## 🔍 TROUBLESHOOTING

### **Issue: "Kaggle API not configured"**
**Solution:** Add `KAGGLE_USERNAME` and `KAGGLE_KEY` to Railway

### **Issue: "Dataset not found"**
**Solution:** Make sure Supabase tables are created

### **Issue: "R2 not available"**
**Solution:** Verify R2 credentials in Railway variables

### **Issue: Processing takes too long**
**Expected:** First dataset takes 3-5 minutes (downloading from Kaggle)

### **Issue: Training fails**
**Check:** Dataset must be processed first (status = "completed")
